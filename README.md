#Stone Match Tracker

During a series of matches against the same opponent, it is easy to get lost in the sauce and lose track of who has already won/lost a round in the current match. Enter the Stone Match Tracker Mod! I desinged this mod to be a lore accurate way an earthbender may keep track of the current match score, which works as follows:

At the end of the first round of a match, they player will summon a pebble from the battle field to keep as a reminder. If the player won, the stone will stay whole, if they lost, the stone will be shattered into pieces. If at the end of the second round there is a tie, the stone will be split in half.
I have also added small win and loss animations to the stone to help complete the mod, please enjoy!
